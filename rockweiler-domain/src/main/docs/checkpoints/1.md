# Goal: User Input #

I want to have a RESTful flow that gets me to a html form where I can enter
names of players.

## Discussion ##

This is purely block and tackle; I need to understand how I'm going to
support the navigation through the application.

I don't expect this to be pretty.  I do expect it to follow RESTFUL
principles.

That means, I need a start point, a link relation that offers me a chance
to do something useful, and an endpoint that creates a form for me.

## Implementation ##

So, to provde a web endpoint, I'll roll out an instance of DropWizard.
The latest version seems to be 0.9.1, so I'll try that.

The dropwizard user manual calls for separating the api and the application
into different modules.  I'm going postpone that separation for the moment.
Everything stays under a single umbrella while I'm in the prototyping stage.

I should follow the package guidelines though.

Not yet sure where the domain model is going to go; but as I don't have one
yet, that can be deferred.

Bootstrapping is a bit annoying.  To get the server up, you need the yaml
file, and the Configuration class needs to match.  I'm not sure that I'm
going to need any configuration until I introduce the persistence layer.

## REST ##

Need to be careful, if we are doing a GET, then the call needs to be cacheable.
In other words, I shouldn't be doing things like including a newly generated uuid.
Instead, that should happen in a post, that does a redirect.  Note that there
still isn't any persistence here, I'm just inventing urls.

Alternatively, I can generate the uuid that I need, and *redirect* the GET.  So
the initial get redirects to a (potentially cachable) copy of the form.  One thing
to keep in mind is that resources are cheap -- we can present many different
identifiers that all map to the same entity.
